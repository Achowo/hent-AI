--Installation--

First install DeepCreamPy. You can install the exe or code.

--hentAI Code:
Install Anaconda3.

Open anaconda prompt, create virtual environment via
	conda create --name hentai python=3.5
Activate that environment
	conda activate hentai

Navigate to your hentAI install directory within conda
	cd *path to hentAI folder*

Install requirements and Mask Rcnn
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python setup.py install

See the suggestions for folder creation below.


--hentAI Executable:
Not required, but you should create a folder to house input images.
	If you plan on using printed black/white images or things with screentones,
	create 2 folders. One folder will be input to Screentone Remover, the other
	will be the output of Screentone Remover and the input to hentAI.

Unzip the downloaded folder, run main.exe and follow the tutorial

>>Tutorial: 
	For Screentone Remover, instructions are in its own file.
	
	First, have an input folder ready with whatever images you want to decensor.
	Do not have bar censors and mosaic censors in the same folder.

	!!!!!!IMAGES NEED TO BE IN .png FORMAT!!!!!

--hentAI executable
	Run main.exe
	Select the kind of censor you have in your input folder
	For "Your own input image folder", select the folder with your images in it.
	For "DCP install directory", selec the parent directory of DeepCreamPy (usually called dist1)
	Now you can hit the Go button. Loading the nueral network will take some time. 
		The image detections will also take some time.
		Depending on your computer, this can take a few minutes or more.
	The images with the detected censors should have automatically been placed into the 
		corresponding folders in your DeepCreamPy directory.
	No you can run DeepCreamPy. Be sure to select the appropriate censor type.
	


--Training:
**If you are interested in training, please contact me and I may provide you with
the current dataset. All I ask is that you also send me your trained model should
you improve on the latest detections. **

Add to the dataset with VGG annotator. Class definitions are on the readme / github page.

Place dataset into the dataset_img folder. Please have a train and val folder.
Dataset annotation format should be on Readme or the hentAI git page.

Optionally, you can inspect the dataset with the samples\hentai\inspect_h_data.ipynb
This is meant for jupyter notebook.

From parent directory of hentAI:
tensorflow==1.9.0 is HIGHLY reccomended to get any useful training progress.
You will need a powerful Nvidia gpu, like around a gtx 1080 or better.

	pip install tensorflow==1.9.0

	python samples\hentai\hentai.py train --dataset=dataset_img/ --weights=weights.h5
		can also use --weights=last if you have another trained model.

There will be a lot of compatibility warnings and such. But the training will still run.
Model should be placed in a logs folder, outside the hentAI folder.
You can use tensorboard to inspect the loss graph visuals.

Inspect the model detections with either hentAI or sampels\hentai\inspect_h_model.ipynb
You may modify the jupyter notebook to test the current model and your new model
simultaneously. Again, if you procure better results, you may create a pull request or just
send it to me!
