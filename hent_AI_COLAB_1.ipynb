        "In your Google Drive, make a folder called hent-AI. Inside that folder, make a folder called videos. \n",
        "\n",
        "Don't worry about getting the weights or models. This repo will auto download them to this Google Drive folder for you, so make sure your drive isn't full.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Tutorial:\n",
        "Now, you can start running this notebook. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Under the runtime option above, hit '**Change runtime type**' and make sure Hardware Accelerator is set to **GPU**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Then, start running the code cells below by hitting the play buttons on their top left. (Or hit Runtime->Run all). They each have comments and instructions if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Some of the cells will require input, as a y/n box. Make sure to do those or else nothing will continue.*\n",
        "\n",
        "* When you mount the google drive and have to authorize it, be sure to select your google account that you wish to place the models and videos on.\n",
        "\n",
        "* When decensoring finished, the output video will be called `(video name)_decensored.avi` \n",
        "\n",
        "* The filesystem is the window looking button on the right. Click on it, and you'll see the local hent-AI folder dropdown, and the drive folder above it. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Expand the hent-AI folder, then the expand drive / My Drive folders\n",
        "\n",
        "* Simply drag the decensored video avi from the hent-AI folder to the drive/My Drive folder. This will transfer the decensored video from this instance to your actual Google Drive, and is the fastest way to get the video. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Or, you can right-click the video and download from here, but it will be much slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Notes\n",
        "Colab **automatically disconnects** if you dont do anything for 30 minutes, and sessions last **at most** 12 hours. Whenever you launch a new instance, You will have to run all these steps again. But, everything on your Google drive (like the  can stay and it does not have to be repeated. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, its best if you have all the clips you want to decensor ready so you can run them all at once."
